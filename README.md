## Data Structures Project

This repository was developed alongside with [Thodwrhs Myridis](https://github.com/tmyridis) during the course Data Structures on the 2nd Semester of our studies in CSD AUTH and contains implementations of a binary tree, an AVL tree and a hash table with open addressing. These data structures were implemented for comparison on search times for words of a txt file. For this comparison, besides the three data structures there were also other classes implemented for handling, text processing and comparison on search times. Also, for "predicting" the correct size of the hash table a linear model using least squares method was implemented.
